### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Aselav(or Aslv in game), I'm basically an idiot.

My long term goal is to turn programming into a possible life career.

My short term goals are to do whatever comes to mind.

Right now, what I do is help around the block with my friend, whos working on a Discord bot, [Acoustic](https://acoustic.to).

I'm basically the right hand man in terms of managing the server. I also *kind* of help with the website.
